OpenCV Cascades
===============

The OpenIMAJ library only support the older cascade format, so I've had to regenerate additional ones and use the `-baseFormatSave` on the `opencv_traincascade` command to get the right data format.

Recreated from https://bitbucket.org/Joe_Howse/angora-blue/ with minor modifications (see https://bitbucket.org/anjackson/angora-blue/).
